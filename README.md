This is a revised landing page for ROCKETMODS.
The logo is from the Rocketman website for demonstration purposes.
The contents of the webpage are in the index.html file.
The file features internal CSS and the images are included in the source file itself.
This layout ,unlike the previous landing page, emplyes the Grid method. This is a more efficient way of laying out a webpage and more versatile than the table method.
